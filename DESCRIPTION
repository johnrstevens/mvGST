Description: mvGST provides platform-independent tools to identify GO terms (gene sets) that are differentially active (up or down) in multiple contrasts of interest.  Given a matrix of one-sided p-values (rows for genes, columns for contrasts), mvGST uses meta-analytic methods to combine p-values for all genes annotated to each gene set, and then classify each gene set as being significantly more active (1), less active (-1), or not significantly differentially active (0) in each contrast of interest.  With multiple contrasts of interest, each gene set is assigned to a profile (across contrasts) of differential activity.  Tools are also provided for visualizing (in a GO graph) the gene sets classified to a given profile.
